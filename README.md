This is a project started as an accessibility-oriented story reader, but it's also designed help people improve their focus and attention span by giving the reader a series of short, bite-sized reading tasks. 
The app is also an experiment on my hypothesis that scary stories are better when the words are read at the right pace in the right amounts.
Hence, the screen reader formats all stories into short, two-sentence bites that are easy to read and the user will naturally find the right pace to read the story. 
This improves the story experience over reading the more traditional singular essay-style text format.

This app is also hoping to tap into and harness the natural human drive for story-telling. People are always self-publishing their own original stories and posting them on places like reddit, or even fanfiction.net. 
I wanted to encourage and capture the energy people pour into writing their own stories... and I wanted to target a specific audience: fans of the horror genre.

There are still many more features to be added to enhance the story-telling experience (e.g. An text-to-speech voice, automatic sound effects, and AI-generated visuals).
